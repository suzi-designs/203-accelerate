Shows the latest tweets from a Twitter account in a sidebar widget.

== Description ==
This plugin displays the latest posts from a Twitter account in a sidebar widget. 
Easy customization of style, replies, retweets, links, dates, thumbnails and a lot more.

The plugin is based on Twitter API version 1.1. 
In order to use it, you have to create a personal Twitter Application on the [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com/apps "dev.twitter.com") website.
Within your Application, Twitter provides two strings: the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret.
You also need two other strings, the Access Token and the Access Token Secret, that you can get
following [this guide](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom "this guide").
Finally, enter all the Authorization string in the widget options box, along with your favorite display settings: your Twitter Widget is now ready and active!

You can use the same Authorization strings for several widgets and multiple website. 
Just remember to store them in a safe place!

You also need CURL and OPENSSL extensions enabled in your PHP environment (don't worry, almost every hosting service provides that).

= Shortcode =

If you want to put your recent tweets other than in a widget, you can use the [good_old_twitter] shortcode. 
The shortcode support is experimental. 

At the moment at least the twitter username and the 4 authentication attributes are mandatory. The shortcode minimal configuration is (with all fields filled):

[good_old_twitter username="" consumer_key="" consumer_secret="" access_token="" access_token_secret=""]

You can specify other optional attributes, e.g.:

* num (number of tweets to show, e.g. num="10")
* skip_retweets (if set to true, retweets are skipped, e.g. skip_retweets="true")

The full list of available options is available in the plugin FAQ.

== Installation ==
Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure to put all of the plugin files in a folder named `good-old-twitter-widget` (not two nested folders) in the plugin directory, then activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Does the widget show my tweets in real time? =
Yes they're shown in real time, although you have to refresh the page for them to appear.

= How can I modify the styles? =

The plugin follows the standard rules for "ul" and "li" elements in the sidebar. You can set your own style modifying or overriding these rules:
.good_old_twitter_widget { /* your stuff */ }
.good_old_twitter_widget li { /* your stuff */ }

As for the linked username on the bottom (if enabled), you can customize it this way:
div.gotw_link_user { /* your stuff */ }

= I've enable user thumbnails. How can I make them look better? =

You can use some CSS rules like these:
`.good_old_twitter_widget     { margin-left:0; }`
`.good_old_twitter_widget li  { margin-bottom:6px; clear:both; list-style:none;   }`
`.good_old_twitter_widget img { margin-right :6px; float:left; border-radius:4px; }`

= What filters are available? =

* The "gotw_link_user" filter applies to the link to the Twitter user profile
* The "gotw_button_follow" filter applies to the Twitter "Follow Me" button
* The "gotw_output" filter applies to the final widget frontend output

All the filters are provided with the plugin's complete array of options.
